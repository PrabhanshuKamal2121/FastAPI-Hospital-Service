A modern, scalable, and robust **Patient Management System API** built with **FastAPI** and **Pydantic** for managing patient records efficiently. This API allows you to create, read, update, delete, and sort patient data stored in a JSON file, with built-in validation and computed fields like BMI and health verdicts.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete patient records.
- **Data Validation**: Uses **Pydantic** for strict type checking and validation of patient data.
- **Computed Fields**: Automatically calculates BMI and assigns a health verdict (Underweight, Normal, Obese).
- **Sorting**: Sort patient records by height, weight, or BMI in ascending or descending order.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses for invalid inputs or missing records.
- **FastAPI Integration**: High-performance API with automatic OpenAPI documentation.
- **JSON Storage**: Persistent storage of patient data in a JSON file.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **Python**: Core programming language for the application.
- **JSON**: Lightweight data storage for patient records.
